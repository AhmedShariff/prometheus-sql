# File that defines endpoints for exposing Prometheus metrics for SQL result sets.
# It talks to a [SQL Agent](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/sql-agent) service that
# performs the query against the target database and returns the result set.
# The `driver`, `connection`, `sql`, and `params` options defined for each endpoint
# are passed to the service to execute the query. The other options are specific
# to this service.

# Name of the endpoint. It will be accessible at /query.

    # Name of the driver to use.

    # SQL string. Parameters are name-based (not positional) and must be
    # prefixed with a colon. See `:category_id` in the query below for an example.
